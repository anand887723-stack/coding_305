js comes with the browser inbuild it is not like the js or python so that we 
have to install it seperately , it just comes as free inbuilt pacakge, either with the 
node js or with the browser engines, 
like even in the js , we don't have the print statements, it is all given by the so called
api of the browser. 
so in the overall sense js is just a languge which is used for giving the instructions 
to the engines 

THIS WAS ABOUT JS RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT 

js follows functional programing paradigm 
node js is an enviroment 
vanila js is normal js 
react js , angular js is an optimized script which tells the developer that 
just write the code instructions in my own langauge and i will give you the optimized code to
run .
